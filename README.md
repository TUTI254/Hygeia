This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Karibu  Hygeia , a platform that connects patients to doctors . The platform allows patients to book appointments with doctors and have 1:1 consultations that they would normally find in a hospital. The platform also allows doctors to manage their appointments and give them their recommendations after diagnosis. 


First, run the development server:


```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
